  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hannah, 22 years old and I aspire to become a fullstack web developer.</p>

<p>I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology at Consolatrix College of Toledo City, Inc. My journey is filled with continuous will to learn new technologies. Learning has never been a dull thing to me and I want to apply what I've learned into something that is both practical and useful in everyday tasks. I am hoping that through this course, I will make my aspirations come true.</p>

<p>I hope we can be friends. Thank you for visiting my page.</p>
